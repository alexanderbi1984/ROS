Please note that my implimentation of the ball tracker does 
not rely on the color of the ball. You can see it in the video
I am using a green ball instead of a red one. To track the ball,
I use the Hough transform on RGB image to detect the circle to
track the ball. The reason I use RGB raw image is that it is more
reliable and less noise than the depth raw image.

The tracker node is mainly designed by myself except that the subscriber
struture is based on the code in the following link.
https://github.com/jjones646/turtlebot-follower/blob/master/src/turtlebot_gt/src/tracker.py
The idea on how to obtain the depth information from depth image raw efficiently 
is my own work which is not seen from any code online.

The follower node is mainly borrowed from the code in the following link.
https://github.com/jjones646/turtlebot-follower/blob/master/src/turtlebot_gt/src/simple_follower.py
What I only change is the parameters which best suits for my trakcer node and fix of
a bug in the following line.
        coord = [float(x) for x in str(data.data).split(',')]
The original code is
        coord = [float(x) for x in str(data).split(',')]
