The Youtube link for navigation task is https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EW-Z2Aixfxo
The link for auto exploration is https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrBqhmrxSlM
I got two methods to construct the maps.
Assignment2.launch is the method used in youtube video.
Assignment2_alternative.launch can also be used to constuct the map.The 
map used in navigation video is constructed based on the alternative method.
